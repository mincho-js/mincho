# Compilation diagnostics and optimization

Module analysis shares one lexical resolver for imports, require bindings and
re-exports. It keeps import and require conditions separate and refuses mutable,
ambiguous or cyclic definitions. Graph traversals own their scopes; later
transforms do not reuse mutable Babel scopes from another traversal.
